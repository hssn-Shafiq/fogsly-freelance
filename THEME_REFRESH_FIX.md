# Theme Refresh Fix

## Problem
When creating a new theme in the admin panel, it wasn't appearing in the frontend header theme switcher immediately. The theme options were only refreshed when navigating away from the admin page.

## Solution
Implemented immediate theme refresh by:

1. **App.tsx**: Added `onThemeChange` prop to `AdminPage` component that calls `refreshThemesFromAdmin()`

2. **AdminPage.tsx**: Updated to accept and pass the `onThemeChange` prop to `ThemeManagement`

3. **ThemeManagement.tsx**: Added calls to `onThemeChange()` after all theme operations:
   - Creating a new theme
   - Updating an existing theme
   - Deleting a theme
   - Toggling theme status
   - Setting default theme

## How It Works
1. Admin creates/modifies a theme in the admin panel
2. After successful operation, `onThemeChange()` is called
3. This triggers `refreshThemeOptions()` in the main app
4. Theme options are reloaded from Firestore
5. Header theme switcher is updated with the new theme list
6. New themes are immediately available for selection

## Testing
1. Go to admin panel (http://localhost:5175/admin)
2. Create a new theme with custom colors
3. Navigate back to the main site
4. Check the header theme switcher - your new theme should appear
5. Select the new theme to see it applied site-wide

## Files Modified
- `App.tsx` - Added onThemeChange prop to AdminPage
- `pages/AdminPage.tsx` - Updated interface and passed prop to ThemeManagement
- `components/admin/ThemeManagement.tsx` - Added refresh calls after all theme operations
