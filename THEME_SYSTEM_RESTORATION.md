# Theme System Restoration

## Changes Made

### 1. Restored Static Theme System
- **types.ts**: Reverted `Theme` type back to `'light' | 'dark' | 'desert'`
- Removed `ThemeOption` interface as it's no longer needed for frontend

### 2. Header.tsx Restoration
- Removed dynamic `themeOptions` prop from `HeaderProps`
- Restored static theme switcher with hardcoded light, dark, and desert themes
- Fixed both desktop and mobile theme switchers to use static themes
- Removed dependency on dynamic theme loading

### 3. App.tsx Simplification
- Removed all dynamic theme system imports (`themeIntegrationService`)
- Removed `themeOptions` state and related loading state
- Simplified theme handling back to basic static theme switching
- Removed theme refresh functionality
- Restored simple `handleThemeChange` function without async operations

### 4. Admin System Preserved
- **AdminPage.tsx**: Removed `onThemeChange` prop (no longer needed)
- **ThemeManagement.tsx**: Removed `onThemeChange` prop and all refresh calls
- All admin theme management functionality remains intact
- Admins can still create, edit, delete, and manage themes
- Theme preview functionality still works within admin panel

## What Works Now

### Frontend (Non-Admin)
- ✅ Static theme switching (light, dark, desert) in header
- ✅ Themes apply correctly site-wide
- ✅ No dependency on Firestore for frontend theme switching
- ✅ Fast, simple theme changes

### Admin Panel
- ✅ Full theme management (create, edit, delete, preview)
- ✅ Theme status toggle (active/inactive)
- ✅ Set default theme functionality
- ✅ Color customization with live preview
- ✅ All admin authentication and permissions

## What Changed

### Before
- Dynamic themes from Firestore appeared in frontend header
- Theme options loaded from database on app start
- Real-time theme refresh after admin changes

### After
- Static themes only in frontend header (light, dark, desert)
- No database dependency for frontend themes
- Admin theme management completely separate from frontend
- Faster, simpler frontend experience
